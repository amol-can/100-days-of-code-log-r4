## 10. Test REST API with Postman
### Day 10: October 24, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![RestDB.io](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-18-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-18.jpg)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

As part of the work required to host a copy of my version of the Udacity Mobile Web Nanodegree Restaurant app, I have to change all the Ajax requests to use my new hosted DB solution.

I chose a great hosted solution made available by [restdb.io](https://restdb.io).

Their service allowed me to:

- Create a NoSQL DB
- Create collections and define their fields
- Populate these with data
- Access the data through an instantly available REST API

The next part involved constructing all the new requests and testing each of the new endpoints to ensure I was able to perform each operation as expected.

I first started by identifying each endpoint I'm currently using from my local DB. I then read RestDB's excellent docs on how to build equivalent requests to access the same data.

I used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to track, build, & test each request.

You can read more here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 4: Section 3 Test REST API](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage4.html#3-test-rest-api).

## 9. RestDB.io Hosted DB
### Day 9: October 23, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![RestDB.io](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-2-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-2.jpg)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

I've settled on a great Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering. They allow you to

- Create a NoSQL database
- Define the schema and model
- Populate it with data
- Query against it using an auto-generated REST API
- Free to set up a Developer account

This was perfect for replicating the local Node.js/Sails.js database that was provided us. And it relieves me from having to find a hosted Node.js solution.

Now I can change my Ajax calls to point to and use my new data source and be up and running.

## 8. Cloud Services Defined
### Day 8: October 22, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![On-Premises, Iaas, Paas, Saas](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-1-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-1.jpg)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

The nanodegree only had three stages to complete in order to meet all requirements.

I’m adding a fourth stage which will include necessary changes to properly host this app as part of my online portfolio.

I started researching various Cloud services in order to find a solution to host the Restaurant app's back end database and REST API.

In that effort I documented the following in my code notes

- Wrote out a set of requirements
- Researched NoSQL Databases
- Learned about & defined various cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, DBaaS, SaaS)
- Investigated hosted DB Solutions

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 4: Section 1 NoSQL with RESTful API](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage4.html#14-stage-3-review).

**Progress:** Completed the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I submitted my project for review and got the results back.  It passed with flying colors which made the extra weeks I put into it worth while.

One thing that threw me off though was the first line of the reviewer's feedback, "where he said, "Great attempt". Whad'ya mean "Great attempt?!?".😂😂

It then went on to tell me that I had in fact completed the nanodegree! Whew!😅

**Progress:** Completed the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

This last part required me to tighten up the performance scores on this app.

I ran the tests from Chrome's DevTools audits panel and did the following to bring the scores up

- Created gulp tasks to inline my js and css
- Reduced image quality (and file size) in my image compression gulp task

The new scores are enough to pass!

## 4. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Offline Favorites
### Day 4: October 9, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Offline Favorites Toggle](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-21-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-21.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I completed the last piece of functionality for this app which is the ability to mark a restaurant as a favorite while the app is offline.

I added the following:

- Set click handlers for the favorite buttons
- Created a function to use Fetch API when updating the online DB
- Added error handling which updates the data locally
- Created code to save all requests when offline and then send to server when connected once again.

## 3. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Kill Page Refresh
### Day 3: October 7, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Data Displays without Refresh](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-20-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-20.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

There were two places in my app where I was lazily reloading the page in order to redraw the data on the page.

This was clunky and didn't make sense to do since I was using Ajax everywhere else to eliminate round-trips to the server.

## 2. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Post Offline Data
### Day 2: October 6, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Save Offline Data](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-15-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-15.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

In this part of my project I finished the offline data processing queue. This is responsible for sending offline review data to the server once connectivity is re-established.

The code does the following:
1. On page load it gets the all offline requests as an IDB cursor
2. It opens the first request and attempts to POST it with fetch
3. If we are offline then it skips to the next and tries again
4. Once we do successfully POST we get the resulting record back
5. We then delete the offline request from the offline store
6. We add the new review record and delete the old record from reviews store
7. The add & delete is done in the same transaction so if it fails it rolls back

## 1. Created Round 4 Code Log
### Day 1: October 5, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![new code log](assets/images/code-log-1-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-1.jpg)

**Progress:** Created a new GitHub repo for my Round 4 code log.

This now uses a dusky rose theme and has an updated nav which I've migrated over to my previous two logs.

I'm still finishing up my Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree...

Hopefully will be done in another week...
