I got my project feedback and was given a handful of great suggestions in the code review. These include:

- Add error handling for Ajax  calls
- Don't break code into too many components
- Careful of not mutating state accidentally through shallow copy of objects
- Consider implementing Jest for test coverage in order to take it up a notch

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I focused building a dynamic search. As the user types the search page dynamically displays the results.

This involved:

- Building a controlled component
- Invoking Ajax request on input change
- Implementing debounce to limit number of requests
- Handling edge cases where data is missing

Today was about making Ajax call in the appropriate places and then processing those requests.

- Used `componentDidMount()` for fetch requests
- Used Promise-based syntax for processing requests
- Used `setState()` to update app's state

```jsx
  componentDidMount = () => {
    BooksAPI.getAll().then(books => {
      this.setState({ books: books });
    });
  };
```

## 89. React Bookshelf Project Add Book State
### Day 89: February 10, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I began adding interactivity to my React app. This started with introducing state to track my list of books. Here are some of the things added to the code

- Create handler method to manage updating book shelf a book belongs to
- Passed method as props to child components
- Used higher order functions to mutate data before using setState to update UI

## 88. React Bookshelf Project Pass Data with Props
### Day 88: February 9, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Now that the data is available inside the App, I started figuring out what to pass as props to each nested child component.

Here are a few steps I took.

- I started with a books object containing all books for the bookcase
- Passed that as props to Bookcase component
- Filtered that to get the books by shelf
- Passed the filtered books to each Bookshelf component
- Looped thru filtered book list to render each Book component

## 86. React Bookshelf Project Create Components
### Day 86: February 7, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Live Demo:** [reactnd-project-myreads@3-split-components](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-project-myreads/tree/3-split-components/) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I split up the code into components. This created a component hierarchy that I could then use on different pages of my app.

By the time I finished I had many more levels of nesting than I thought I would. But from what I read it's best to have small components with minimal code for reusability rather than building large & overly complicated ones.

Here's the hierarchy so far.

- BooksApp
  - Route {ListBooks}
    - Bookcase
      - Bookshelf
        - Book
          - BookshelfChanger
    - OpenSearchButton
  - Route {SearchBooks}
    - SearchBar
      - CloseSearchButton
      - SearchBooksInput
    - SearchResults
      - Book
        - BookshelfChanger

## 85. React Bookshelf Project Add Routing
### Day 85: February 6, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

class BooksApp extends Component {
  state = {};
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="app">
        <Route exact path="/" component={List} />
        <Route path="/search" component={Search} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**Live Demo:** [reactnd-project-myreads@2-routing](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-project-myreads/tree/2-routing/) on CodeSandbox

<!-- [![Chrome](assets/images/code-log-85-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-85.jpg) -->

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I added React Router to the app and used that rather than relay on state to conditionally display UI.

This has the benefits of:

- Tracking browser/page history
- Ability to use back & forward browser buttons
- URL bar shows URL specific to pages: '/home', '/search', 'detail', etc.
- Ability to bookmark pages

This is the first of three projects that I have to complete successfully in order to receive my Nanodegree.

This project is book shelf app that tracks books

- I'm reading
- Want to read
- Have read

It should allow you to search for books, add books, and move them between shelves.

## 83. React Contact Form
### Day 83: February 4, 2018 - Monday

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson wrapped up the Create Contact input form and completed the operation by saving the record to the database.

This required the following to work properly.

- Implement `form-serialize` pkg to so I could programmatically serialize the form fields
- Pass serialized form fields to our App component's `createContact` method
- Implement `history.push` within Route component's render prop.

This last part "navigates" the app to our Contact List page.

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson got me familiar with four key components of React Router.  These are:

- **BrowserRouter component** - Wraps App and provides a specialized history object
- **Route component** - Matches route on path and renders content on a match
- **Link component** - Provides links for navigation within the app that tie to the history object
- **Redirect component** - Redirects to a specific route

 React Router is great in that it preserves & tracks nav history and allows you to use the browser's back button. It also provides rendering based on the Route defined.

 It basically provides navigation for React Single Page Applications.

So today was spent Reading React Router docs and debugging something that was right in front of me the whole time.

I was using the `setState` method rather than the `state` property in my comparison. Unfortunately, the editor didn't flag this as an error because it thought I was doing an assignment rather than an equality check.

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson introduced the concepts behind React Router and had us attempt to mimic this functionality through state.

Many things did not work including back button navigation, & proper state management.

React Router seems to solve for this by providing a framework to manage navigation of React Single Page Applications.

I also implemented a separate Create User page and added navigation buttons to the React Contacts App.

## 79. Lifecycle Event Stages
### Day 79: January 31, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

These last two days were spent diving deeper into the various stages that each  lifecycle event occurs at.

Here’s a list of the most common events in the order in which they occur.

- Mounting
  - constructor()
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()
- Updating
  - render()
  - componentDidUpdate()
- Unmounting
  - componentWillUnmount()

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Now I've moved onto Lifecycle Events. These are special methods that each component has which allows us to run custom behavior during certain times of the component's lifecycle.

Some of the ones discussed were

- componentDidMount()
- componentWillUnmount
- getDerivedStateFromProps

## 77. React Chat App
### Day 77: January 28, 2018 - Monday

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This is the last exercise in the State Management section of my React Fundamentals course.

It started with the basics of a chat application but it was non-functioning and all the code was static and placed in a single component.

I needed to split the app up into functional components and add code to make the app work. This was done through the use of props, state, & handler methods.

I broke the app down along the following lines.

- App (green)
  - ChatWindow (blue)
    - MessageHistory (yellow)
    - MessageInput (red)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Now I'm at the part of the course were we're give a page of requirements and asked to build the app from scratch.

The first thing I did was draw out the UI elements. Then I drew squares around each separate functional area in order to create a component hierarchy.

Here's what I used for the UI above.

- App (blue)
  - UserInput (red)
  - UserList (yellow)
    - User (green)
    - Game Toggle (purple)

This is what the final app looked like

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This exercise had us take a controlled component and split it up to be modularized from one large components to four separate ones.

This took me longer than I thought it would and was trickier than I realized because I had to map out how best to break up the components.

I followed the React docs recommendation of drawing boxes around each logical component

## 74. Controlled Comps Ex 1
### Day 74: January 25, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

This exercise had us create a controlled component who's value was updated by component state.

This is handled by the onChange attribute which is set to handleChange method.

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    value: ""
  };
  handleChange = e => {
    const value = e.target.value;
    this.setState({
      value
    });
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Say Something"
          value={this.state.value}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
        {this.state.value === "" ? (
          <p>This should mirror the text you typed into the input field.</p>
        ) : (
          <p>{this.state.value}</p>
        )}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson was all about Controlled Components which are form elements who's state is managed by React state rather than the DOM.

I learned how to

- assign state to an input's value
- create a handleChange method to update state when text is entered into the input
- hook the handleChange method up to the input through the onChange event

## 72. React PropTypes
### Day 72: January 23, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson introduced [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html). PropTypes allows you to define the datatype we expect to be passed to the component that PropTypes is defined for.

Here are some of the things you can define with PropTypes

- array, bool, func, number object, string, symbol
- isRequired or optional
- arrayOf and shapeOf for arrays and objects

Here's a sample of what PropTypes defined for a ListContacts component might look like.

```jsx
ListContacts.propTypes = {
  contacts: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.shape({
      id: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      handle: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      avatarURL: PropTypes.string.isRequired
    })
  ),
  onDeleteContact: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};
```

## 71. React Mental Math App
### Day 71: January 22, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf32-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf32.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson took me 3 days to complete properly. It consisted of building out a simple Mental Math game with **props** and **state**.

I learned about the following

- Lifting state to a parent component
- Passing data and handler functions as props
- Binding 'this' to handler defined in a parent component
- Avoid using .bind() and arrow functions in render() methods

I read a couple great articles by Cory House on the subject.

> #### ⚠️ Avoid arrow functions & .bind() in render() ⚠️
> We generally want to avoid declaring arrow functions or binding in render() for optimal performance.
>
> You can set up [this ESLint rule (jsx-no-bind)](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-bind.md) to help alert you to this issue.

## 70. React - Main Concepts
### Day 70: January 20, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![React Docs](assets/images/code-log-70-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-70.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I spent the day going through [React's Main Concepts documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). This consists of 12 sections that build upon each other and that each detail a different fundamental aspect of the React ecosystem.

This was key to my digesting so many of React's key concepts. It serves to fill in any blank spots and gives clear direction on things like:

- Lifting State Up
- Composition of components
- How props and state differ and what should be tracked in each
- How to tackle creating a React UI in 5 steps (Thinking in React)

I love how clear the examples are and that each one links to a CodePen that you can play with.

## 69. Update Component State
### Day 69: January 19, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf29-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf29.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson consisted of updating component state.

State can be set with `setState()` and can either be done by passing in a function.

```jsx
// setState function
this.setState(prevState => ({ // <- implicit return of an object
  count: prevState.count + 1
}))
```

or it can be done by passing in an object

```jsx
// setState object
this.setState({
  username: 'James'
})
```

Once state is updated React knows this and will call render() to re-render the component. This allows for fast, efficient updates to the app's UI.

## 68. Adding Component State
### Day 68: January 18, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf25-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf25.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson consisted of adding state to a component.

Here are some take-aways.

- React `props` represent "read-only" immutable data
- React `state` on the other hand represents mutable data
- React `state` is tied to how the application looks
- An update to state, updates the UI

To add state to our components, all we need to do is add a state property to our class whose value is an object. This object represents the state of our component.

We can either add it as a class field,

```jsx
class User extends React.Component {
  state = {
    username: 'Tyler'
  }
}
```

or we can add it in the constructor

```jsx
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      username: 'Tyler'
    };
  }
}
```

## 67. Functional Components
### Day 67: January 17, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf27-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf27.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's exercises consisted of converting class components to stateless functional components.

Once again, this should be done if our component only has a `render()` method.

Here's the MovieCardList component.

```jsx
const MovieCardsList = props => {
  const { profiles, users, movies } = this.props;
  const usersByMovie = {}; // create empty object

  profiles.forEach(profile => {
    const movieID = profile.favoriteMovieID; // get movieID as key

    if (usersByMovie[movieID]) { // loop thru ea. profile item
      usersByMovie[movieID].push(profile.userID); // push user onto array
    } else { // else if movie key does not exit
      usersByMovie[movieID] = [profile.userID]; // assign user array to key
    }
  });

  const movieCards = Object.keys(movies).map(id => (
    <MovieCard
      key={id}
      users={users}
      usersWhoLikedMovie={usersByMovie[id]}
      movieInfo={movies[id]}
    />
  ));

  return <ul>{movieCards}</ul>;
}
```

Here's the child MovieCard component.

```jsx
const MovieCard = props => {
  const { users, usersWhoLikedMovie, movieInfo } = props;

  return (
    <li key={movieInfo.id}>
      <h2>{movieInfo.name}</h2>
      <h3>Liked By:</h3>

      {!usersWhoLikedMovie || usersWhoLikedMovie.length === 0 ? (
        <p>None of the current users liked this movie.</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {usersWhoLikedMovie &&
            usersWhoLikedMovie.map(userId => {
              return (
                <li key={userId}>
                  <p>{users[userId].name}</p>
                </li>
              );
            })}
        </ul>
      )}
    </li>
  );

## 66. Stateless Fn Components
### Day 66: January 16, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![component state](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/26-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/26.jpg)

**Progress:** Today I learned about Stateless Functional Components

The lesson focused on refactoring the list portion of the UI shown above from a class component to a functional one.

Here are a few bullet points on using functions in place of classes for components.

- Can be used if our class component only has a `render()` method
- Simpler and reduced syntax
- Takes in props and returns UI
- Doesn't rely on 'this' keyword

One key take-away from the lesson was the statement.

> "If you’re using React correctly, you’re going to notice you have a lot of components that simply take in some data via props and output some UI"

## 65. React Popular Movies
### Day 65: January 15, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf23-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf23.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I worked on more React props exercises. This one required the following:

- Splitting the UI over multiple nested components
- Mapping, filtering, and resolving data from objects
- Converting between objects and arrays using `Object.keys()` & `Object.values()`

Here's some sample code.

```jsx
class PopularMovies extends Component {
  render() {
    const { profiles, users, movies } = this.props;
    const moviesArr = Object.values(movies);
    return (
      <div className="PopularMovies-container">
        {moviesArr.map(movie => (
          <div key={movie.id} className="PopularMovies-cell">
            <h3>{movie.name}</h3>
            <UserList movieID={movie.id} users={users} profiles={profiles} />
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## 64. React Favorite Movies
### Day 64: January 14, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf21-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf21.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I worked on a props exercise. It required the following:

- Passing three different data sets with props
- Mapping over one of the data sets to create related elements
- Using the other two data set object stores as lookups for display data

Here's an example of the data used.

```js
const profiles = [
  {
    id: 1,
    userID: '1',
    favoriteMovieID: '1',
  },
  // more records...
];

const users = {
  1: {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Jane Cruz',
    userName: 'coder',
  },
  // more records...
};

const movies = {
  1: {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Planet Earth 1',
  },
  // more records...
};
```

## 61. CodeSandbox & React
### Day 61: January 11, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Code Sandbox](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf8-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf8.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today I used [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) to quickly spin up React dev environments for testing out various React concepts.

I LOVE this app. It is super easy to use. Includes ESLint, Prettier, great UI. Also has a beautiful editor with clean Color Themes and awesome monospace font (Dank Mono).

I used it to work on the following lesson exercises.

- React & ReactDOM libraries
- React.createElement
- Nested elements
- List data
- JSX
- Component Intro

## 60. React Higher-Order Functions
### Day 60: January 10, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![jsx map](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf3-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rf3.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued my Udacity React Nanodegree Program.

Today's lesson discussed

- Unidirectional data flow in React (vs bi-directional for Angular & Ember)
- JavaScript higher-order functions such as map, filter, & reduce
- ES6 syntax - destructuring, spread, and rest operators

Then the lesson started skirting the realm of Functional Programming with concepts of **currying** and **functional composition**

I was kind of blown away by the following code sample...

```js
const shelf1 = [{name: 'book1', shelf: 'a'},{name: 'book2', shelf: 'a'}];
const shelf2 = [{name: 'book3', shelf: 'b'},{name: 'book4', shelf: 'b'}];
const allBooks = [...shelf1, ...shelf2];

const filter = books => shelf => books.filter(b => {
  return b.shelf === shelf;
});

// currying.. produces array with 2 objects: book3 & book4
const shelf = filter(allBooks)('b'); // (2) [{...}, {...}]

console.log(shelf); // (2) [{...}, {...}]
```

Notice the use of double arrow functions in the `filter` function expression we created.

```js
const filterBy = filter(allBooks); // partial function
const booksOnShelf = filterBy('b');

console.log(booksOnShelf) // (2) [{...}, {...}]
```

Here we see the use of **currying** and **partial functions**. We also see the use of double arrow functions on the same line. The Blog Post [Currying and ES6 Arrow Functions](http://codekirei.com/posts/currying-with-arrow-functions/) does a great job of explaining this sorcery.

## 58. Component State
### Day 58: January 8, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![component state](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/22-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/22.jpg)

**Progress:** Today I documented everything that went into creating state for a component.

This includes:

- Updating the App structure to use require & module exports (CommonJS)
- Building the component
- Adding default state in the class constructor
- Creating a function to update state
- Hooking up the click handler
- Using `.bind` to make sure `this` is in the right context
- Applying style based on state

## 57. React State
### Day 57: January 7, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![Popular component](assets/images/code-log-57-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-57.jpg)

**Progress:** Today I build my first component that used State.

The previous day was spent on JavaScript's `this` keyword along with `.call()`, `.apply()` and `.bind()` function methods.

This was a necessary precursor to understanding how to manage state and set the context of the `this` keyword.

The component I built was a simple clickable list that kept track of which item was clicked.  This will be part of a larger UI that displays detail information based on the selected language.

## 56. 4 Types of Binding 'this'
### Day 56: January 6, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

```js
// Implicit Binding
// Left of the Dot at Call Time
var me = {
  name: 'James',
  age: 48,
  sayName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

me.sayName(); // James
```

**Progress:** Today I reviewed the `this` keyword in depth.

`this` is one of the most misunderstood aspects of JavaScript because it's context changes based on how the function or method containing `this` is invoked.

I learned there are 4 types of binding for `this` keyword.

- **Implicit Binding** - based on context/object used to call the function
- **Explicit Binding** - **.call()**, **.apply()**, or **.bind()** used to invoke the function
- **new Binding** - invoked with a **new** keyword and set to the newly created object
- **window Binding** - bound to the **window** object if the function is not called using any of the previous three options

The lesson goes into depth regarding what specifically is happening in each of the cases above and gives code examples.

## 55. React Composition & PropTypes
### Day 55: January 5, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![component](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/18-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/18.jpg)

**Progress:** Today I learned about the following:

- Functional composition
- Stateless Functional Components
- Pure functions
- Type checking with PropTypes

Here's an example of components written as functions.

```jsx
const ProfilePic = function(props) {
  const { username } = props;
  return <img src={`#${username}`} alt="" />;
};

const ProfileLink = function(props) {
  const { username } = props;
  return <a href={`https://www.fb.com/${username}`}>{username}</a>;
};

const Avatar = function(props) {
  const { username } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Stateless Functional Components</h3>
      <ProfilePic username={username} />
      <ProfileLink username={username} />
    </div>
  );
};
<Avatar username="james-priest" />
```

Here's an example of PropTypes being defined.

```jsx
Users.propTypes = {
  list: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string).isRequired
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Users list={['Tyler', 'Mikenzi', 'Ryan', 'Michael', 23]} />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## 54. React List map & filter
### Day 54: January 4, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![vscode](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/16-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/16.jpg)

**Progress:** Today I worked with lists using `.map` & `.filter`.

- Map allows us to cycle through an array and output each value to the UI
- Filter allows us to return array elements that match a certain condition

Here's a basic mapping example that uses a parent and child component.

```jsx
class FriendsContainer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'James Priest';
    const friends = ['Evi', 'Joeylene', 'Brittany', 'Anusha', 'Divya'];
    const containerStyle = {
      border: '1px solid blue',
      padding: '10px'
    };
    return (
      <div style={containerStyle}>
        <h3>Name : {name}</h3>
        <ShowList names={friends} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class ShowList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { names } = this.props;
    const listStyle = {
      border: '1px solid red',
      padding: '10px'
    };
    return (
      <div style={listStyle}>
        <h3>Twitter Friends</h3>
        <ul>
          {names.map(friend => (
            <li key={friend}>{friend}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<FriendsContainer />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## 53. React Props & State
### Day 53: January 3, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![vscode](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/13-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/13.jpg)

**Progress:** Learned about props today.

Here are some specifics

- React is very good at managing state
- The system for passing data from one component to a child component is through props
- Props are to component what arguments are to functions

Here's a basic way of coding the component above.

```jsx
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

class Badge extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Badge 1</h1>
        <img src={this.props.img} alt="" />
        <h2>Name: {this.props.name}</h2>
        <h3>Username: {this.props.username}</h3>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Badge
    name="James Priest"
    username="james-priest"
    img="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/27903822?s=460&v=4"
  />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## 52. React Nanodegree
### Day 52: January 2, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Udacity React Nanodegree

[![Udacity React Nanodegree](assets/images/code-log-52-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-52.jpg)

**Progress:** I signed up for Udacity's React Nanodegree program today.

I had such a good experience with the Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program that I figured I'd use Udacity to get my React training as well.

This is a four months program that will cover the following:

- React
- Redux
- React Native

We will also be required to build a separate project using each of the three technologies in order to receive our certification and complete the program.

## 51. ESLint, Airbnb, & Prettier
### Day 51: December 31, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Configure linting & code formatting in VS Code for React development.

[![vscode](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/12-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/12.jpg)

**Progress:** I spent the last 8 days experimenting with every kind of linting and code formatting configuration I could find for React development within VSCode.

I knew I wanted the following:

- Error highlighting
- Emphasis of best coding practices
- Nicely formatted code

I found that in the following:

- **ESLint** for linting, **Airbnb** for coding style, and **Prettier** for code formatting.

 So far, so good. The real craziness started with trying to determine which packages, plugins, & configurations I should be using.

In all, I tried about 20 different package combinations before getting everything to work properly.

Here are a couple things I learned.

**Prettier & ESLint explained**

- **Prettier** ([https://prettier.io](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)) formats your code and nothing more. It's opinionated and therefore only has a few configurable formatting rules (single or double quotes, semi colon, etc.). It will reformat your code but does not help with code quality.
- **ESLint** ([https://eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)) handles both code quality AND code formatting (depending on which rules or Style Guide you use). If you use Prettier then you should turn off ESLint's code formatting rules. There are packages to do this automatically.
- **Airbnb** ([https://github.com/airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)) Provides a set of code style rules from which to work. This covers possible errors, best practices, and stylistic choices.

## 50. First React Component
### Day 50: December 25, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

```jsx
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello React!</div>
    )
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

**Progress:** This part of the course began deconstructing the aspects of a React component. It also contrasted that with a React element.

Learned about

- React & ReactDOM modules
- ES6 Classes
- JSX
- render method

## 49. React Webpack Config
### Day 49: December 24, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

<!-- [![npm install](assets/images/code-log-48-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-48.jpg) -->

```js
// In webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './app/index.js',
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js)$/, use: 'babel-loader' },
      { test: /\.css$/, use: { 'style-loader', 'css-loader' }}
    ]
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: 'app/index.html'
    })
  ],
  mode: "development"
}
```

**Progress:** The next step in this course was learning how to configure Webpack.

> Webpack, at its core, is a code bundler. It takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a new version of your code.

I learned about

- Setting an entry point
- Using loaders for transformations
- Setting the output directory
- Specifying an HTML template
- Using webpack-dev-server

## 48. Npm Scopes
### Day 48: December 23, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![npm install](assets/images/code-log-48-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-48.jpg)

**Progress:** Learned something new about npm!

#### Old way

Previously, I was installing all my babel packages without using `@babel` scope.  This means my installs looked like this.

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-react
```

It would then place these three related packages in the root of `node_modules` directory.

#### New way
Now I see I can install related packages to the same scoped directory provided the scoped packages exist.

The same install would look like this.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

Here's the directory structures

```text
OLD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE         NEW DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
/node_modules                   / node_modules
  - babel-core                    - @babel
  - babel-preset-env                - core
  - babel-preset-react              - preset-env
                                    - preset-react
```

This is a lot cleaner and allows me to keep related packages together.

## 47. React Fundamentals
### Day 47: December 22, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** [Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/)

[![React Ecosystem](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/10-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/assets/images/10.jpg)

**Progress:** Just started Tyler's React Fundamentals course.

I haven't done any coding yet but I love that he takes the time to set the stage and give some necessary context to what React is all about.

He started by explaining some of the features of React.

- Uses Composition
- Declarative
- Unidirectional data flow
- Explicit mutations
- Just JavaScript

He then breaks down the React ecosystem and explains the following:

- React
- React Router
- Webpack
- Babel
- Axios

Lastly, he covered additional examples of imperative vs declarative code and the benefits of declarative.

See my notes [React Fundamentals 1. Why React](https://james-priest.github.io/tm-react-fundamentals/react-fundamentals.html) to get a better sense of the material covered including:

- Why React
- The React Ecosystem
- Imperative vs. Declarative

## 46. Roman Numeral Convert
### Day 46: December 21, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

[![Roman Numeral Converter](assets/images/code-log-46-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-46.jpg)

**Progress:** Redoing some JavaScript Algo's

Now that I have my cert, I'm going back to see where I can refactor and update code. This was a Roman Numeral Converter that required some array manipulation.

I used `.map`, `.split`, `.reverse`, & `.join`. This one was fun bc it challenged without being too difficult.

**Progress:** Last project completed!

This is the second [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) certification that I had started in 2017 but had to put on hold because of my Udacity Nanodegree scholarship.

I finished the last of the final projects today!

This cert actually represents approximately 300 hours of coursework but I still have yet to complete the exercises for each of the sections.

Now that I have the cert, I'm going back to do  each of the exercises before attempting the final projects once again. This will show me anything new I've learned and will give me a chance to refactor and tighten up my code.

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![Restaurant App](assets/images/restaurant_app-small.jpg)](assets/images/restaurant_app.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Restaurant Review App](https://restaurant-review-app.netlify.com)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration is complete!

This app was my capstone project for Udacity's Mobile Web Dev Nanodegree.

The project required that we code against various HTML5 APIs with vanilla Javascript. We were not to use the assistance of any frameworks or external libraries except for a Promise library that wrapped the IndexedDB API.

Here's a high level list of some of the functionality this app needed to produce.

- Asynchronous requests (Ajax)
- Offline-first capability
- Fully Responsive Design
- ARIA compliant, Accessible, and Screen Reader/Assistive Technology capable
- Highly optimized & performant (90+ Audit metrics for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, PWA)

Here's a partial list of the APIs and technologies we needed use and demonstrate.

- Service Worker
- Cache API
- JavaScript Promises
- ES 2015 Syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, sting literals, sets, etc.)
- Fetch API
- Web Workers
- Build systems (Grunt, Gulp, BrowserSync, Babel, etc.)
- Progressive Web App features (Service Worker, App Manifest, caching, etc.)

## 10. Test REST API with Postman
### Day 10: October 24, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

As part of the work required to host a copy of my version of the Udacity Mobile Web Nanodegree Restaurant app, I have to change all the Ajax requests to use my new hosted DB solution.

I chose a great hosted solution made available by [restdb.io](https://restdb.io).

Their service allowed me to:

- Create a NoSQL DB
- Create collections and define their fields
- Populate these with data
- Access the data through an instantly available REST API

The next part involved constructing all the new requests and testing each of the new endpoints to ensure I was able to perform each operation as expected.

I first started by identifying each endpoint I'm currently using from my local DB. I then read RestDB's excellent docs on how to build equivalent requests to access the same data.

I used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to track, build, & test each request.

## 9. RestDB.io Hosted DB
### Day 9: October 23, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![RestDB.io](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-2-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-2.jpg)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

I've settled on a great Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering. They allow you to

- Create a NoSQL database
- Define the schema and model
- Populate it with data
- Query against it using an auto-generated REST API
- Free to set up a Developer account

This was perfect for replicating the local Node.js/Sails.js database that was provided us. And it relieves me from having to find a hosted Node.js solution.

Now I can change my Ajax calls to point to and use my new data source and be up and running.

## 8. Cloud Services Defined
### Day 8: October 22, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Host Restaurant Review app

[![On-Premises, Iaas, Paas, Saas](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-1-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/4-1.jpg)

**Progress:** Restaurant Review PWA migration

The nanodegree only had three stages to complete in order to meet all requirements.

I’m adding a fourth stage which will include necessary changes to properly host this app as part of my online portfolio.

I started researching various Cloud services in order to find a solution to host the Restaurant app's back end database and REST API.

In that effort I documented the following in my code notes

- Wrote out a set of requirements
- Researched NoSQL Databases
- Learned about & defined various cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, DBaaS, SaaS)
- Investigated hosted DB Solutions

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 4: Section 1 NoSQL with RESTful API](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage4.html#14-stage-3-review).

## 6. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Project Results
### Day 6: October 12, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Final Project Results](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-31-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-31.jpg)

**Progress:** Completed the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I submitted my project for review and got the results back.  It passed with flying colors which made the extra weeks I put into it worth while.

One thing that threw me off though was the first line of the reviewer's feedback, "where he said, "Great attempt". Whad'ya mean "Great attempt?!?".😂😂

It then went on to tell me that I had in fact completed the nanodegree! Whew!😅

## 5. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Performance Tuning
### Day 5: October 11, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![DevTools Audits Panel](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-23-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-23.jpg)

**Progress:** Completed the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

This last part required me to tighten up the performance scores on this app.

I ran the tests from Chrome's DevTools audits panel and did the following to bring the scores up

- Created gulp tasks to inline my js and css
- Reduced image quality (and file size) in my image compression gulp task

The new scores are enough to pass!

## 4. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Offline Favorites
### Day 4: October 9, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Offline Favorites Toggle](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-21-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-21.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I completed the last piece of functionality for this app which is the ability to mark a restaurant as a favorite while the app is offline.

I added the following:

- Set click handlers for the favorite buttons
- Created a function to use Fetch API when updating the online DB
- Added error handling which updates the data locally
- Created code to save all requests when offline and then send to server when connected once again.

## 3. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Kill Page Refresh
### Day 3: October 7, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Data Displays without Refresh](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-20-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-20.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

There were two places in my app where I was lazily reloading the page in order to redraw the data on the page.

This was clunky and didn't make sense to do since I was using Ajax everywhere else to eliminate round-trips to the server.

## 2. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Post Offline Data
### Day 2: October 6, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Save Offline Data](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-15-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-15.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

In this part of my project I finished the offline data processing queue. This is responsible for sending offline review data to the server once connectivity is re-established.

The code does the following:
1. On page load it gets the all offline requests as an IDB cursor
2. It opens the first request and attempts to POST it with fetch
3. If we are offline then it skips to the next and tries again
4. Once we do successfully POST we get the resulting record back
5. We then delete the offline request from the offline store
6. We add the new review record and delete the old record from reviews store
7. The add & delete is done in the same transaction so if it fails it rolls back

## 1. Created Round 4 Code Log
### Day 1: October 5, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![new code log](assets/images/code-log-1-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-1.jpg)

**Progress:** Created a new GitHub repo for my Round 4 code log.

This now uses a dusky rose theme and has an updated nav which I've migrated over to my previous two logs.

I'm still finishing up my Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree...

Hopefully will be done in another week...
